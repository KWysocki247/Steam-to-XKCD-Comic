# Steam to XKCD Comic
 Utilizes JavaScript, NodeJS, HTML, XKCD API, and Steam API

This was a project for my Web Development class where we had to utilize two different API's to accomplish a task. I chose to combine the Steam API and XCKD API and create a project in which you enter a valid Steam ID and then you are returned a comic based on the time your Steam account was created. 

This project only works if the Steam Profile is public and not private.
